# CSP-Experiments

This repository contains python implemention of basic CSP solving algorithms for solving cryptarithmetic puzzles.

The implemetion contains the basic backtracking algorithm, backtracikng using MRV, LCV heuristics and backtraining using constraint propagation techniques like FC and MAC.

The experiments contain the execution of these algorithms on 4 popular cryptarithmetic puzzles. The soltuions and the time takes by each algorithm is also shown.
